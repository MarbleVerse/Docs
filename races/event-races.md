# 🎁 Event Races

“Special Events” will be organized regularly where rewards will be unique NFTs. These Special Events will have entrance fees; participants will pay Rollium to enter. Rollium collected from these events will be transferred to the Development pool.&#x20;

Transactions from the NFT Marketplace will have transaction fees. For every transaction, the system will cut a fee of 5% to transfer to the Development pool.&#x20;

To transfer Rollium earned from the Play2Earn system to their wallet, players will pay a certain percentage of their earning as a fee. The Fee percentage will get lower as the amount of Rolium goes up, incentivizing players to spend or hold their tokens in-game.
