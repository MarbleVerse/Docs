# 🎁 Event Races

“Special Events” will be organized regularly with unique NFTs or way bigger amounts of Rollium as rewards. These Special Events will have entrance fees; participants will have to pay Rollium to enter.

* Rollium collected from special events with NFT rewards will be transferred to the Development Pool.
* Rollium collected from special events with Rollium rewards will create a Rollium pool which will be distributed fairly amongst the winners. A small percentage of this pool will be transferred to the Development Pool as well.
